# MSDCIR-AD: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Multi-criteria Semantic Distances and Constrained Image Reconstruction
This is the code implementation for the paper titled:"MSDCIR-AD: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Multi-criteria Semantic Distances and Constrained Image Reconstruction"(Submitted to COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY)

# Requirements:
numpy=1.23.1  
opencv-python=4.7.0.72  
pillow=9.4.0  
scikit-learn=1.2.1  
scipy=1.9.1  
tensorboard=2.12.3  
torch=2.3.0  
torchvision=0.18.0

# Download Pretrained Models
You can easily get all pretrained models required by inference from Baidu cloud disk.   
Finally, these pretrained models should be organized as follows:  
./checkpoint/  
|-- 512/  
|   `-- MVTAD  
|   `-- BTAD  
|   `-- visa  
|-- 256/  
|   `-- MVTAD  
|   `-- BTAD  
|   `-- visa
